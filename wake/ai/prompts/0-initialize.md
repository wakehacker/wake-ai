# Initialize the codebase

<task>
Initialize the codebase for a security audit. The `wake` tool should be running successfully, so that it is able to properly compile the codebase and run static analysis commands and other.
</task>


<steps>

1. **Install dependencies**
    - Install all required dependencies for the codebase (those might be `npm`, `pnpm`, `yarn`, etc.)
    - Analyse the codebase and identify all dependencies
    - If you encounter any issues, try to resolve them
    - Do NOT modify the codebase in any way
    - Keep it simple do not overcomplicate the process
    - If the codebase cannot be initialized, or compiled

2. **Initialize wake**
   ```bash
   wake init
   ```
    - If wake is not able to initialize, try to resolve the issues
    - Do NOT modify the codebase in any way
    - Do NOT force it, if it is not working after a few attempts, leave it as is
